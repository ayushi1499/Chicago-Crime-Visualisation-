# Project Overview: 
This project entails analyzing and visualizing crime data in Chicago using Tableau to uncover insights into crime trends, patterns, and distributions. The study aims to inform public safety initiatives and crime prevention strategies by providing a detailed understanding of crime dynamics across various dimensions such as time, location, and crime type.
# Key Responsibilities:
•Data Collection and Cleaning: Acquired crime data from public datasets, cleaned, and preprocessed the data to ensure accuracy and consistency, including handling missing
values and outliers.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to identify key patterns and trends, such as the distribution of crimes by location, time, and type.
•	Data Visualization: Created interactive dashboards using Tableau to present findings clearly and actionably. Visualizations included:
•	Top 10 Crimes Analysis: Highlighted the most common crimes, with theft being the top crime, accounting for 21.10% of reported incidents, and revealed low arrest rates.
•	Crime Distribution by Location: Identified that most crimes occur on streets, followed by residential areas and apartments, with Austin being the high-crime area.
•	Crime Patterns by Time: Analyzed crime occurrence by hour of the day, showing peak times during lunch hours (12:00-14:00 PM) and the least during early morning hours (4:00-6:00 AM).
•	Monthly and Quarterly Crime Trends: Displayed that July and August have the highest crime rates, while February and December have the lowest, and quarterly analysis showed fewer crimes in the first quarter.
•	District Crime Analysis: Showed crime distribution across different districts, identifying district 8 as the most crime-prone.
•	Community Area Analysis: Analyzed and visualized crime rates in different community areas, identifying safer areas like Edison Park.
•	Arrest Rates Analysis: Examined arrest rates for different crime types, noting varying rates for domestic crimes and a general observation that most criminals were not arrested in reported cases.

# Key Achievements:
•	Insightful Visualizations: Developed comprehensive dashboards that provide clear, actionable insights into crime patterns and trends in Chicago.
•	Pattern Recognition: Identified significant crime patterns and hotspots, aiding in the allocation of public safety resources.
•	Public Safety Enhancement: Contributed to public safety improvement efforts by providing data-driven insights that help in strategic planning and decision-making.

# Key Data Insights:
•	Crime Distribution: Theft is the most common crime, and Austin is the most crime-prone area.
•	Trends Over Time: Crime rates have been decreasing over the past two decades, with seasonal variations showing fewer crimes in the first quarter.
•	Arrest Rates: Varying arrest rates for domestic crimes, with a general trend of low arrest rates across most crime types.
•	Geographic Distribution: Detailed analysis of crime distribution across community areas and districts, highlighting high-crime zones and safer areas.

# Technical Skills:
•	Data Visualization Tools: Tableau

# Conclusion
Crimes have been decreasing over past two decades.
Most number of crimes happened in Austin.
Most of the reported crimes were of Theft which accounted for 21.10%.
First quarter of the year showed less number of crimes than rest of the year.
Most of the criminals were not arrested in reported crimes case.

# Impact: 
The project enhances the understanding of crime dynamics in Chicago, providing valuable insights that can be leveraged by law enforcement agencies and policymakers to devise effective crime prevention strategies. The visualizations and dashboards developed serve as powerful tools for ongoing monitoring and analysis, facilitating a data-driven approach to public safety.
